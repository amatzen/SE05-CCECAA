\section*{Report}

\subsection*{The context}
% give some general information about the company and its domain, specifications, and competitive advantages (the teacher assesses if the student understands the context, cloud providers' services, and their customers' needs).



\subsection*{The specified problem}
% specify a problem the provider/customer face, and argue that in functional/non-functional levels [they may indirectly deal with a problem and avoid mentioning it in the presentation, for instance, when they explain their solutions on sustainability, scalability, etc. However, there should be a problem for which a solution is proposed] (the teacher makes sure the student understands issues that could be solved or raised by Cloud adoption)

\subsection*{The solution methodology}
% explain how the cloud provider/customer solves the specified problem, what methods they use, what process/architecture they follow, and how their solution stands better than other solutions [you may need to search a little bit in addition to what you hear in the speeches] (the teacher assesses if the student understands various solutions offered by cloud providers and adopted by customers)

\subsection*{Theoretical and technical validity of the solution}
% based on your experience as a software engineer, how would you analyze the solution's feasibility and quality? (the teacher looks for the student's analysis capability and innovative mind and sees how they can frame their previous education in specific problems in the Cloud Computing domain)

\subsection*{Takeaways}
% explain what you have found interesting/trending/applicable/revolutionary in the talk (the teacher would like to see the student's comprehension of novel trends and applications.
